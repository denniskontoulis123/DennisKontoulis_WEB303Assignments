            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>JGL was born on February 17th, 1981 in LA, California.  He was born to a Ashkenazi Jewish family, and his parents were founders of the Progressive Jewish Alliance.  
                Gordon's father was once the news director for the Pacifica Radio station.  His mother ran for congress before he was born.  His grandfather was a Hollywood film director; 
                one can argue that it was always in the cards for him to be such a succesful actor!</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Career</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>JGL has been part of a massive laundry list of movies.  His career goes as far back as featuring in movies such as Halloween H20, and the hit classic 10 Things I Hate About You.  
                He also does voice work; having voiced in Treasure Planet as well as a film from the monolith of animated films, Studio Ghibli, in The Wind Rises.  </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>While JGL has not won an Academy Award, he has won other awards; 10 total, to go alongside 48 total nominations.  He has won an Emmy for his work on television show Create Together, 
                as well as Satelitte and Screen Actors Guild Awards for The Trial of the Chicago 7 (a fantastic movie that in my opinion deserved Oscars).  Astoundingly, he had never won anything for 
                his most notable film; (500) Days of Summer, though he came close.</p>

                <p>Joseph started his acting career early by playing Scarecrow in a production of The Wizard of Oz.  He was approached by an agent shortly thereafter and began 
                appearing on television series as well as in commericals.  At six he starred in several made-for-television films.  His breakout roles would wind up being supporting roles in 
                Halloween H20: 20 Years Later as well as 10 Things I Hate About you- a modenr retelling of Shakespare's Taming of the Shrew.  His talent would not go unnoticed, landing him his voice acting 
                role in Treasure Island.  In 2000 he began attending columbus university, where he studied history, literature and French Poetry.  He attributes his growth as an invidual to 
                his move to New York City in his youth.  He would eventually drop out to concentrate solely on his acting career. </p>

               <p>JGL has really only directed one film- Don Jon in 2013 -but it was released to positive critic reviews as well as high audience favor.  He has directed short films, 
                but nothing else for the so called big screen.  Don Jon, though, was a tremendous film in my opinion, and a wonderful critique of masculinity and how society forces 
                harmful stereotypes onto men writ large.

                JGL is known for his discretion.  However, it is publicly known that he married Tasha McCauley, a robotics engineer and entrepreneur, in December 2014.  The couple is known for their commitment to keeping their relationship out of the public eye.  
                They have two sons, born in August 2015 and June 2017, respectively.  JGL has expressed his desire to protect his children's privacy and provide them with as normal a childhood as possible, away from the limelight.  Apart from his acting career, Gordon-Levitt is a musician;
